# The Odin Project ‚Äì Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to various tasks and exercises from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal of this repo is to document my learning progress, practice fundamental concepts, and keep a history of my growth as a developer.

## üìã About

- **Purpose**: These are practice exercises, not production-level apps
- **Focus**: Building strong foundations in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, React, and other core web development skills
- **Approach**: Each solution is written from scratch without relying on external libraries unless explicitly required

## üéØ Topics Covered

- **HTML & CSS basics** (layouts, grid, flexbox, forms, etc.)
- **JavaScript fundamentals** (functions, objects, arrays, DOM manipulation)
- **Git & GitHub workflow**
- **Browser APIs and event handling**
- **React** (components, props, state, hooks, and working with APIs)
- **Step-by-step progression** toward full-stack projects

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This repository is **not** meant to showcase polished portfolio projects. For my complete, production-ready apps (with authentication, deployment, and polished UI), see my pinned repositories on my GitHub profile.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each exercise is organized in its own directory with clear documentation. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
