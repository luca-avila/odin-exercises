# Jest Testing Practice

This is a simple Jest testing practice project. I've already done TDD and unit testing before, so this is just for practicing Jest syntax and setup.

## What's included

-   Basic function testing with Jest
-   Simple unit tests for utility functions
-   Calculator class with static methods
-   Basic test structure and assertions

## Note

This is purely for Jest practice purposes. I'm not covering every edge case or implementing comprehensive test suites since the focus is on getting familiar with Jest testing framework syntax and configuration.

## Running tests

```bash
npm test
```
